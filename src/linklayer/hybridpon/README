Hybrid TDM/WDM-Passive Optical Network (PON)
============================================

* Shortdesc: "hybridpon" is an implementation of hybrid TDM/WDM-PON
* Author: Kyeong Soo (Joseph) Kim (kyeongsoo.kim@gmail.com)
* License: GPLv2
* Requires: OMNeT++ 4.0 or later

The 'hybridpon' provides essential components at Physical and Data
Link Layers to build simulation models for various flavors of hybrid
TDM/WDM-PON systems.


* Features:
Modular design allowing dynamic loading of different MAC and
schedulers at run time


* Notes:
This project was originally started as a joint work between Stanford
Networking Research Center (SNRC), Photonics & Networking Research Lab
(PNRL), Stanford, and Advanced System Technology (AST),
STMicrolectronics.
  
With the OMNeT++ 4.0 which brings a lot of fundamental changes all
over the simulation framework, supporting packages, and models,
however, we decided to start from scratch and now the whole code base
(i.e., "inet-hnrl") is being developed and maintained by Hybrid
Networking Research Lab (HNRL), Swansea University, Wales, UK.
