INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The INET Framework can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 4.0 or later.

1. Make sure your OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (to test, try the command "which nedtool").

If you are building from command line:
--------------------------------------
3. Change to the INET directory.

4. Type "make makefiles". This should generate the makefiles for you automatically.

5. Type "make" to build the inet executable (debug version). Use "make MODE=release"
   to build release version.

6. you can run specific examples by changing into the example's directory and executing "./run"

If you are using the IDE:
-------------------------
3. Open the OMNeT++ IDE and choose the workspace where you have extracted the inet directory.
   The extracted directory must be a subdirectory of the workspace dir.

Note:
-----
If you add/remove files/directories later in the src directory, you should regenerate 
your makefile in the src directory with:

opp_makemake -f --deep --make-so -o inet -O out

If you are using the IDE, it will do it for you. You don't have to do anything.
