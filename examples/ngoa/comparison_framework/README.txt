The 'equivalence_framework (EF)' is a set of simulation models and
scenarios for a comparison study of 10-Gb/s next-generation optical
access (NGOA) architectures based on the equivalence framework using
OMNeT++ and INET-HNRL, which provide a complete end-to-end
communication environment for model architectures including a TCP/IP
protocol stack, application protocols, and user behavioral models for
traffic generation.
