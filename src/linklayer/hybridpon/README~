Passive Optical Network (PON) Layer
===================================

* Shortdesc:	"pon" is a simulation model for PON layer
* Author:		Kyeong Soo (Joseph) Kim (kyeongsoo.kim@gmail.com)
* License:		GPLv2
* Requires:		OMNeT++ 4.0 or later

The 'pon' provides essential components at Physical and Data Link
Layers to build simulation models for various flavors of PON systems
(TDM, WDM, hybrid TDM/WDM, and so on).

* Features:
  - Modular design allowing dynamic loading of different MAC and
    schedulers at run time

* Notes:
  This project was originally started as a joint work between Stanford
  Networking Research Center (SNRC), Photonics & Networking Research
  Lab (PNRL), Stanford, and Advanced System Technology (AST),
  STMicrolectronics.
  
  With the OMNeT++ 4.0 which brings a lot of fundamental changes all
  over the simulation framework, supporting packages, and models,
  however, we decided to start from scratch and now the whole code
  base (i.e., "inet-hnrl") is being developed and maintained by Hybrid
  Networking Research Lab (HNRL), Swansea University, Wales, UK.
